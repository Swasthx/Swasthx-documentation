# PHR App Release Guidelines

This document outlines the standard procedures for releasing updates to the Swasthx PHR Application.

## 1. Tools used

- **GitHub** – Source control for every codebase (PHR, website, and supporting tools). The organization lives at [github.com/Swasthx](https://github.com/Swasthx); request collaborator access from the admin.
  - Identify the repositories used for PHR frontend/backend and website frontend/backend work.
- **Google Play Console** – Used to publish Android builds. Access the console at [play.google.com/console](https://play.google.com/console/u/3/developers/7322562159725037649/app-list) once the admin shares permissions.
- **App Store Connect** – Used for iOS releases. Sign in at [appstoreconnect.apple.com](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/login) after being added to the Swasthx account.
