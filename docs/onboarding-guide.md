# SwasthX Developer Onboarding Guide

## Welcome to SwasthX!

This guide will help you set up your development environment, understand our documentation structure, and get familiar with our codebase and workflows.

## Documentation Navigation

### Finding Information
1. **Home Page**
   - Start with the [home page](/)
   - Cards are organized by category (Development, Database, APIs, etc.)
   - Each card lists key content areas with direct links

2. **Search**
   - Use the search bar at the top right
   - Search by keywords, file names, or content

3. **Table of Contents**
   - Each page has a collapsible TOC
   - Shows h2 and h3 headings
   - Click any heading to jump to that section

### Documentation Maintenance

1. **Updating Documentation**
   - Documentation lives in the `docs` directory
   - Follow these file naming conventions:
     - Use kebab-case for filenames (e.g., `coding-standards.md`)
     - Keep file names short but descriptive
   - Update the `last_updated` field in the front matter when making changes

2. **Style Guidelines**
   - Use clear, concise language
   - Break content into short paragraphs and lists
   - Use headings to organize content (h2 for main sections, h3 for subsections)
   - Add code examples where helpful
   - Include relevant screenshots for UI elements

3. **Review Process**
   - Create a PR for documentation changes
   - Request review from at least one team member
   - Update the changelog for significant changes

## Development Environment Setup

### 1. Install Node.js and npm
- Download and install from [Node.js official website](https://nodejs.org/)
- Verify installation:
  ```bash
  node --version
  npm --version
  ```

### 2. Install MongoDB

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Swasthx/swasthx_Backend.git
cd swasthx-backend
```

### 4. Install Dependencies
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 5. Environment Setup
1. Copy the example environment file:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```
2. Update the `.env` file with your local configuration

## Development Workflow

### 1. Branching Strategy
We use Git Flow with the following branch types:
- `main` - Production code
- `develop` - Integration branch for features
- `feature/*` - New features
- `bugfix/*` - Bug fixes
- `hotfix/*` - Critical production fixes

### 2. Creating a New Feature
1. Create a new branch from `develop`:
   ```bash
   git checkout develop
   git pull origin develop
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "feat(module): add your feature"
   ```

3. Push your branch:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a Pull Request (PR) to `develop`

### 3. Code Review Process
- All PRs require at least one approval
- Address all review comments before merging
- Ensure all tests pass
- Update documentation if needed

## Testing

### Running Tests
- Unit tests: `npm test`
- E2E tests: `npm run test:e2e`
- Test coverage: `npm run test:cov`

### Writing Tests
- Place test files next to the code they test
- Use descriptive test names
- Follow the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern
- Mock external dependencies

## Platforms We Work With

### Healthcare Integration
- ABDM (Ayushman Bharat Digital Mission)
- [Other healthcare platforms]

### Payment Gateways

## Deployment

### Staging
- Automatic deployment on push to `develop`
- URL: https://staging.swasthx.in

### Production
- Manual deployment from `main`
- URL: https://app.swasthx.in

## Useful Commands

### Database
```bash
# Start MongoDB
mongod --dbpath /path/to/data/db

# Connect to MongoDB shell
mongo

# Reset database (development only)
npm run db:reset
```

### Docker
```bash
# Build image
docker build -t swasthx-backend .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env swasthx-backend

# Run with MongoDB
docker-compose up
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **Port already in use**
   ```bash
   # Find and kill the process
   lsof -i :3000
   kill -9 <PID>
   ```

2. **MongoDB connection issues**
   - Ensure MongoDB is running
   - Check connection string in `.env`
   - Try restarting MongoDB

3. **Dependency issues**
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   ```
