    Cross-API overview


    - The Website backend (WB) and the PHR backend communicate bidirectionally.
        
    - The PHR Mobile app calls the PHR backend, which then coordinates with the
    Website backend to fulfill requests.
        
    - Example: For “Find nearby doctor,” the primary API resides in the Website
    backend. The PHR app sends the request to the PHR backend, which forwards it
    to the Website backend and returns the Website backend’s response to the
    app.

        - URL: {{baseUrl}}/doctor-profile/doctorCheckinUserSlot


        Headers

        - Content-Type: application/json

        - JSON schema and fields:
          {
            "mobileNumber": "string",  // Patient’s mobile number used to identify the user
            "doctorID": "string",      // Unique identifier of the doctor
            "status": "string",        // Check-in state (e.g., "checked_in", "arrived", etc.)
            "time": "string",          // Target slot time (ISO 8601 or server-accepted format)
            "tag": "string"            // Optional tag/remark for this check-in
          }

        Example Payloads

          {
            "mobileNumber": "9876543210",
            "doctorID": "DOC-123",
            "status": "checked_in",
            "time": "2025-01-01T10:30:00Z"
          }
        - With tag:
          {
            "mobileNumber": "9876543210",
            "doctorID": "DOC-123",
            "status": "arrived",
            "time": "2025-01-01T10:30:00Z",
            "tag": "front-desk"
          }

        Expected Responses

        - 201 Created / Success: The check-in was recorded successfully. See the
        saved example: "Request Successful" for an illustrative response.

        - 4xx: Validation or business rule errors (e.g., missing fields, invalid
        slot, user not found).

        - 5xx: Server error.


        Usage Notes

        - Ensure {{baseUrl}} points to the correct environment (dev/stage/prod).

        - Keep Content-Type as application/json.

        - status and time should match what the backend expects; consult service
        rules if custom statuses or time formats are required.

        - This request has no pre-request or test scripts and will inherit any
        auth defined at higher scopes.

        ### Notes


        - Ensure `BookedSlot.time` is a valid future time and aligns with the

        - Provide either `patientAppappointmentID` or `doctorWebAppointmentID`.
            
        - Time values should use ISO 8601 format.
            

        ### Testing Tips


        - Parameterize the base URL using the active environment variable
        `{{baseUrl}}`.
            
        - Store sensitive tokens in the environment or vault (e.g.,
        `{{wb-auth-token}}`).
            
        - Add tests to assert status code, response time, and presence of key
        fields in the response.

        Overview  

        Retrieves OPD (Out‑Patient Department) data for a specific doctor.


        HTTP  

        GET {{baseUrl}}/doctor-profile/doctorOPDdata


        Query parameters


        - doctorID (string, required): Unique identifier of the doctor.  
            • Example: doctorID=DR-12345
            
        - status (string, optional): Filter OPD data by status (e.g., active,
        inactive, all). If omitted, the service may return default/active
        records depending on server behavior.  
            • Example: status=active
            

        Variables


        - {{baseUrl}}: Comes from the active environment (wb-dev-env). Ensure
        this environment is selected so the variable resolves at runtime.
            

        Authentication


        - This workspace exposes tokens/keys as globals (e.g., wb-auth-token).
        If this endpoint requires authentication, inherit it from the
        folder/collection or add a Bearer token in the request/collection using
        the available variable. No auth settings are changed by this
        description.
            

        Saved example


        - Request Successful: See the saved example attached to this request for
        a typical successful response and request context.

        \--data-urlencode "doctorID=DR-12345"  

        \--data-urlencode "status=active"
